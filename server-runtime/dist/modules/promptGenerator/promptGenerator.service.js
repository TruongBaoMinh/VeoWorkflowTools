Think of this as a HERO STILL — one perfect frozen moment that could be a film poster or a Criterion Collection cover. Construct it using these layers IN ORDER:

LAYER 1 — SUBJECT & CHARACTER
  • If characters present: paste their FULL registry description first
  • Exact body pose (weight distribution, hand placement, head angle)
  • Micro-expression (not just "sad" — specify: "eyes glistening with unshed tears, jaw tightened in restrained grief, slight downturn at the corners of the mouth")
  • Wardrobe details relevant to the scene

LAYER 2 — COMPOSITION & FRAMING
  • Shot scale: extreme wide / wide / medium-wide / medium / medium close-up / close-up / extreme close-up / macro
  • Composition technique: rule of thirds, golden ratio, centered symmetry, Dutch angle, leading lines, frame-within-frame, negative space, foreground layering
  • Camera height: worm's eye / low angle / eye level / high angle / bird's eye / overhead
  • Depth layering: describe foreground → midground → background elements explicitly

LAYER 3 — LIGHTING DESIGN
  • Key light: direction (e.g., 45° camera-left), quality (hard/soft), color temperature (warm 3200K / cool 5600K / mixed)
  • Fill light: ratio to key (e.g., 4:1 for dramatic, 2:1 for naturalistic)
  • Rim/back light: presence, intensity, purpose (separation, halo, silhouette edge)
  • Practical lights: in-scene light sources (candles, neon signs, screen glow, window light)
  • Motivated lighting: explain WHY the light exists in the scene (time of day, location, story logic)

LAYER 4 — COLOR SCIENCE & ATMOSPHERE
  • Dominant color palette (3-4 specific colors, not just "warm tones" — e.g., "burnt sienna, muted gold, deep teal shadows")
  • Color contrast strategy: complementary, analogous, monochromatic, split-complementary
  • Atmosphere & particles: haze, fog, dust motes, rain, volumetric light rays, smoke
  • Mood descriptor: one evocative phrase (e.g., "the stillness before a storm breaks")

LAYER 5 — LENS & TECHNICAL
  • Lens focal length feel: 24mm wide-angle distortion / 35mm environmental / 50mm natural / 85mm portrait compression / 135mm telephoto isolation
  • Depth of field: deep focus (everything sharp) / shallow (f/1.4 bokeh) / selective (tilt-shift)
  • Film stock / sensor feel: if applicable per style (e.g., "Kodak Vision3 500T grain structure", "ALEXA Mini LF sensor rendering")

MANDATORY SUFFIX: ", ${args.style}, ${args.aspectRatio} aspect ratio, single frame, one continuous image, no text, textless, no words, no letters, no watermark"

HARD RULES FOR imagePrompt (VIOLATIONS WILL BE REJECTED):
✗ NO movement verbs — forbidden: walks, runs, turns, moves, looks toward, reaches, begins, starts, continues, rotates
✗ NO temporal language — forbidden: then, suddenly, as, while, begins to, starts to, eventually, slowly becomes
✗ NO dialogue, voiceover, speech, or text references of ANY kind
✗ NO narration verbs — forbidden: says, whispers, shouts, tells, explains, narrates
✗ NO on-screen text, subtitles, captions, signs with legible words
✗ NO multi-panel layouts — forbidden: split screen, split-screen, diptych, triptych, collage, photo grid, comic panel, comic strip, storyboard layout, multi-frame, multiple frames, picture-in-picture, side-by-side comparison, before/after split, montage, film strip
✗ NO internal borders, gutters, dividers, or lines cutting the image into sub-panels
✓ ONLY frozen-moment descriptors — allowed: stands, rests, gazes, holds, leans, sits, lies, crouches, grips, balances
✓ imagePrompt is a SINGLE INSTANT — as if a high-speed camera froze time at 1/8000s
✓ SINGLE FRAME ONLY — one camera, one composition, ONE uninterrupted rectangular image. The output must be a continuous photograph/painting with no internal divisions separating different moments, angles, or scenes
✓ "frame-within-frame" as a COMPOSITION technique (e.g. subject viewed through a window or doorway) IS allowed — but the entire output remains ONE unified image, not a grid of separate panels`;

│  Purpose: CINEMATIC MOTION for VEO3 video gen │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Write as ONE CONTINUOUS SENTENCE — a professional shot description that a 1st AD would read on set. Structure it as a temporal sequence with these 6 embedded beats:

BEAT 1 — OPENING FRAME & CAMERA RIG
  • Establish the opening composition (paste the character's full registry description first if present)
  • Specify camera rig explicitly: Steadicam / dolly on track / jib arm / Technocrane / handheld / gimbal (Ronin/MōVI) / drone (FPV or cinema-drone) / locked tripod / macro rail / Snorricam
  • Initial shot scale (ECU / CU / MCU / MS / MWS / WS / EWS) and lens focal length feel (24mm/35mm/50mm/85mm/135mm)

BEAT 2 — CAMERA MOTION & CHOREOGRAPHY
  • Describe camera movement as a CONTINUOUS FLOW with explicit motivation
  • Use professional terminology:
    - Push in / pull back (dolly) — with speed (creeping, slow, measured, urgent, crash)
    - Pan left/right — with arc degree (30°, 90°, 180°)
    - Tilt up/down — with purpose (reveal, conceal, follow eyeline)
    - Orbit / 360° arc — with direction (clockwise, counter-clockwise)
    - Boom up/down (vertical crane)
    - Tracking / following shot — with spatial relationship to subject
    - Whip pan / snap zoom — reserved for punctuation moments
    - Dutch tilt / roll — for psychological disorientation
  • EVERY camera move must be MOTIVATED — tie it to: following action, revealing information, building tension, shifting emotional focus

BEAT 3 — CHARACTER PERFORMANCE & ACTION
  • Specific physical actions with emotional subtext — not "looks sad" but "exhales slowly, shoulders sinking with the weight of a decision just made"
  • Facial micro-expressions that evolve THROUGH the shot (start → mid → end)
  • Body language beats (e.g., "hands clench into fists and release in rhythm with each breath")
  • Interaction between characters (eye lines, physical proximity, mirroring/contrasting postures)

BEAT 4 — DIALOGUE WITH ENGLISH VOCAL DIRECTION
  • Include the EXACT Vietnamese dialogue from the script — no translation, no paraphrasing
  • Wrap each line with English vocal direction before the quote:
    Format: "character speaks with [emotional quality], [vocal texture], [pace/volume]: '[Vietnamese dialogue verbatim]'"
    Examples:
    - "she whispers with trembling fragility, voice barely above a breath: 'Em không thể tiếp tục...'"
    - "he declares with forced bravado masking deep uncertainty, voice cracking mid-sentence: 'Mọi thứ sẽ ổn thôi!'"
    - "the old man mutters in a gravelly, world-weary rasp, each word heavy with decades of regret: 'Ngày đó... ta đã sai rồi.'"
  • If the segment has NO dialogue in the source script, OMIT this beat entirely (do not invent speech)

BEAT 5 — FOCUS & LIGHTING TRANSITIONS
  • Rack focus shifts (from → to, with timing: "slow rack focus from the trembling hand in foreground to the blurred figure approaching in the background over 1.5 seconds")
  • Lighting changes within the shot (cloud passing over sun, neon sign flickering on, candle being extinguished, window light dimming as curtain drops)
  • Exposure / aperture shifts if motivated

BEAT 6 — ATMOSPHERE & SENSORY DETAIL
  • Environmental motion: wind through hair/fabric, rain hitting surfaces, steam rising, leaves falling, dust motes floating in shafts
  • Ambient audio cues that inform the visual generation (implied sound shaping the atmosphere)
  • Overall pacing descriptor: "languid and dreamlike" / "urgent and kinetic" / "measured and deliberate" / "staccato and nervous"

MANDATORY SUFFIX: ", ${args.style}, ${args.aspectRatio} aspect ratio, cinematic color grading, no text, textless, no words, no letters, no watermark"

HARD RULES FOR videoPrompt (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
✓ ONE continuous sentence — commas and em-dashes only, no periods mid-prompt
✓ MUST include explicit camera rig + motion verb (no passive "camera shows")
✓ Dialogue stays verbatim Vietnamese, wrapped in English vocal direction
✗ NO bullet points, NO line breaks inside the prompt string
✗ NO English translation of Vietnamese dialogue`;

    **CRITICAL DESIGN RULES:**
    1.  **Visual Style Consistency:** Every character prompt MUST incorporate the following style: "${safeStyle}".
    2.  **Character Isolation:** Every character MUST be described standing on a **SOLID WHITE BACKGROUND**. Focus exclusively on the character, their physique, facial features, and detailed costume. NO environment, NO background elements.
    3.  **Costume & Shape Focus:** Detail the clothing (fabric, texture, colors, historical/cultural context) and physical attributes (body build, hair texture, eye shape).
    4.  **Safety & Policy Adherence (STRICT):** You MUST bypass policy filters by using "softened" language:
        - NEVER use brand names like "Pixar", "Disney", etc.
        - Soften actions: Instead of "weeping", use "emotional face, wiping a tear". Instead of "kneeling", use "humble posture". 
        - Instead of "barefoot", use "simple rustic peasant shoes".
    
    **CHARACTER SHEET STRUCTURE:**
    For EACH character identified in the script:
    1.  Determine if HUMAN or ANIMAL.
    2.  **Prompt Format:** [Character Name], a [Age] [Nationality] [Gender]. [Physical Features]. [Body build]. [Detailed Costume Description]. [Emotional Demeanor]. Style: "${safeStyle}", entirely on a solid white background, centered, full body view, high-key lighting.

${characterDescriptions}

RULES:
- These descriptions are IMMUTABLE — copy them VERBATIM whenever a character appears.

${stylePreamble}

This style directive is LAW. Every prompt you write must breathe this aesthetic — from color science to lens choice to atmospheric mood.

══════════════════════════════════════════════
 SCENE SEGMENTATION (STRICT)
══════════════════════════════════════════════
- Total duration: ${data.duration}s → MUST output EXACTLY ${data.sceneCount} segments → ~${sceneDuration}s each.
- Segments MUST be numbered sequentially from 1 to ${data.sceneCount} with NO GAPS, NO SKIPS.
- sceneName pattern: "Phân cảnh [1..${data.sceneCount}] (Ns - Ms)" where windows tile the full ${data.duration}s timeline with NO OVERLAP.
- Every segment MUST appear in output even if the script is short \u2014 expand/slow down the narrative OR add cinematic visual beats (establishing shots, reaction shots, atmospheric inserts) to fill the required count.
- \u26d4 FORBIDDEN: skipping scene numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 15), merging segments, or returning fewer than ${data.sceneCount} objects. Output MUST contain scene 1, 2, 3, ..., ${data.sceneCount} in order.
- Respect natural narrative beats \u2014 if a dramatic moment falls near a segment boundary, adjust slightly to preserve emotional coherence BUT keep the segment count unchanged.

 GLOBAL RULES
══════════════════════════════════════════════

1. CONSISTENCY: Maintain spatial continuity between scenes (if a character is by the window in scene 3, don't teleport them to a market in scene 4 without transition logic).
2. ESCALATION: Visual intensity should mirror narrative arc — quieter compositions for reflective moments, dynamic framing for conflict.
3. COVERAGE VARIETY: Vary shot scales across scenes. Don't use medium shots for everything. A sequence should feel like it was covered by a real film crew with multiple setups.
4. LIGHT CONTINUITY: If a scene takes place at golden hour, subsequent scenes moments later should maintain that time-of-day logic.
5. COLOR STORYTELLING: Use color shifts to track emotional arcs (e.g., warmer palette for hope/nostalgia, cooler for isolation/dread).

 TIME SEGMENTATION (8-second windows)
══════════════════════════════════════════════
- Accurately analyze the actual duration of the provided video/audio or script.
- Divide TOTAL DURATION by 8s to get the EXACT number of scenes (round UP if there's a remainder; the final scene may be shorter than 8s but still counts).
- Every scene represents exactly an 8-second window: Scene 1: 0s-8s, Scene 2: 8s-16s, …
- DO NOT arbitrarily pick 7-8 scenes. 16s → 2 scenes. 32s → 4 scenes. 60s → 8 scenes (last is 56s-60s).
- Scene division must respect the visual narrative, action, and dialogue timing.

══════════════════════════════════════════════
 SHORT-FORM PACING NOTES (8s constraint)
══════════════════════════════════════════════
- Compress the 6 BEATS into ONE 8-second sentence — each beat should land quickly.
- Favor a SINGLE strong camera move per scene (no multi-chapter moves in 8s).
- Dialogue (STRICT): when the shot has speech, write 20–25 fast-paced Vietnamese words (~5–7s spoken), punchy and informal. Include English vocal direction inline. Avoid filler phrases.
- Hook (Shot 1 ONLY): MUST open with a pattern-interrupting hook — surprising claim, curiosity question, or sharp benefit. Shot 1 dialogue 15–20 ultra-punchy words.
- Music-only shots: when soft / instrumental music suits the visual better than speech, set the dialogue field to an empty string ("") — do NOT invent narration. Aim for ~1 music-only shot per 4–5 shots, typically mid-narrative or as the final beat for breathing room.
- Opening hook matters — the first 2 seconds must establish subject + lens + light.
${contentType === 'affiliate' ? `

══════════════════════════════════════════════
 AFFILIATE STRUCTURE (mandatory — contentType=affiliate)
══════════════════════════════════════════════
This is an AFFILIATE marketing video — every shot must serve the funnel: catch attention → show product → prove value → drive action.

Required scene roles (apply to the appropriate scenes based on count):
- Scene 1 — HOOK: pattern interrupt + product reveal in the first 1.5s. Dialogue is a punchy 15–20 word question or claim that sparks curiosity (e.g. "Bạn từng nghĩ thứ này có thật không?", "3 phút thôi, bạn sẽ tin nó rẻ thật").
- Scenes 2-3 — SHOWCASE: zoom / orbit on the product. Character interacts naturally (cầm / dùng / đặt cạnh). Dialogue calls out the pain point and how the product solves it. 20–25 words.
- Scene 4 (or middle) — BENEFIT: concrete proof — a number, a comparison, a before/after fact ("rẻ hơn 40%", "dùng 2 năm vẫn mới", "1 nút bấm là xong"). 20–25 words.
- Final scene — CTA: clear call to action — "link ở bio", "comment GET", "quét mã". 10–15 punchy words.

DIALOGUE LANGUAGE: 100% Vietnamese, casual TikTok / livestream tone. NO English code-switching except the literal brand name. Use slangy connectors (cái này, đây, xem nè, đỉnh thật).

NEGATIVE: avoid generic narration ("Hôm nay tôi sẽ giới thiệu..."), avoid corporate ad voice, avoid English filler ("amazing", "wow", "trust me").
